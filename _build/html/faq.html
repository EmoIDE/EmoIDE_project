<section id="what-are-the-main-features-of-the-tool">
<h2>What are the main features of the tool?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-main-features-of-the-tool" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The tool offers several main features to enhance the software development process. These features include:</p>
<p>Emotion Monitoring: The tool incorporates affective computing techniques to monitor developers’ emotional states during their work. It analyzes physiological signals such as eye movements (saccades), blood volume pulse (BVP), galvanic skin response (GSR), and electroencephalography (EEG) to identify and correlate specific emotions.</p>
<p>Emotional Feedback: Based on the analysis of developers’ emotional states, the tool provides real-time feedback and notifications within the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This feedback helps developers become aware of their emotional well-being, enabling them to make informed decisions about their work patterns and productivity.</p>
<p>Code Quality Suggestions: The tool leverages emotional data to make suggestions regarding the quality of code written in different emotional states. It can identify code segments at the monitor that were looked at while the developer was in a distracted or stressed state, highlighting the need for special attention before integration into the system or product.</p>
<p>Work Break Recommendations: By recognizing when a developer has been working in an apprehensive state for an extended period, the tool can suggest the need for a break. This feature promotes a healthy work-life balance and helps prevent burnout by encouraging developers to take breaks when necessary.</p>
<p>Flow State Preservation: The tool recognizes when a developer is in a “flow” state, characterized by high focus and productivity. It provides notifications to minimize interruptions, ensuring that developers can maintain their optimal performance and creativity during these periods.</p>
<p>Integration with Existing IDEs: The tool is designed to be integrated as a plugin in the Visual Studio Code Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). This allows developers to leverage its features seamlessly within their preferred development environment.</p>
<p>Please note that these are the main features of the tool, and there may be additional functionalities and capabilities depending on the specific implementation and version of the IDE plugin.</p>

<section id="are-there-any-known-limitation-or-known-issues-with-the-tool">
<h2>Are there any known limitation or known issues with the tool?<a class="headerlink" href="#are-there-any-known-limitation-or-known-issues-with-the-tool" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> While using the tool, there are a few known limitations and issues to be aware of:</p>
<p><strong>Limiation:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The tool may have limitations in accurately capturing a wide range of emotions. It might primarily focus on specific emotions like arousal and valence which can be translated into stress and flow. Therefore, it is important to understand the specific emotional dimensions the tool measures and interpret the results accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>Greater amount of sensor provides greater accuracy in response: The accuracy of the tool’s response may vary depending on the number and quality of sensors used. Using a greater number of sensors can potentially provide more precise and reliable measurements. It is advisable to consider the sensor setup and configuration to optimize the accuracy of the tool’s readings.</p></li>
<li><p>Data recordings over longer periods and multiple sessions may clutter up the drive: If the tool records data over extended periods or multiple sessions, it can result in a significant amount of data being stored locally. This accumulation of data may consume storage space and potentially clutter the drive. It is recommended to regularly review and manage the stored data, ensuring sufficient disk space is available and organizing the data files to maintain a well-structured record.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Known issues:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The AI is unable to make a prediction if the user is registered as a female in the settings. This is because the model was exclusively trained data from one male. To fix this one would need to retrain the model on a dataset containing data from one or more women.</p></li>
<li><p>At the moment a user can’t initate multiple sessions in a row and can’t close the connection after a session. This is because the live_dashboard_thread keeps running in the background and we are unable to stop it. We have done everything in our power to stop it. We wish you all the luck</p></li>
<li><p>The data labeling tool doesn’t work since it crashes everytime we call any function using easyGUI. We think this is because both easyGUI and matplotlib uses tkinter which causes trubble if we run them both at the same time. We didn’t manage to find a solution to this issue</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to keep these limitations and issues in mind when using the tool, as they can impact the accuracy and usability of the recorded data. Understanding these factors will help you make informed decisions and effectively interpret the results obtained from the tool.</p>

<section id="if-i-want-to-dive-deeper-about-the-data-being-recorded-where-should-i-look">
<h2>If I want to dive deeper about the data being recorded, where should I look?<a class="headerlink" href="#if-i-want-to-dive-deeper-about-the-data-being-recorded-where-should-i-look" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> To explore the recorded data in more detail, you can refer to the locally saved files located in the folder named <strong>Server/Output/</strong>. Within this folder, you will find dataframes that contain the recorded data. These dataframes provide a structured representation of the data, allowing for further analysis and exploration.</p>

<section id="does-the-tool-have-any-built-in-security-measures-to-protect-my-data">
<h2>Does the tool have any built-in security measures to protect my data?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-the-tool-have-any-built-in-security-measures-to-protect-my-data" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The tool’s security is solely reliant on the user, as all recordings and communications are performed and saved locally. It is essential for the user to ensure appropriate security measures are in place to protect their data.</p>
<p>Since the tool operates locally, the responsibility of securing the data rests with the user. It is recommended to follow best practices for securing your computer and the storage location where the data is saved. This may include using strong passwords, encrypting the storage device, implementing firewall and antivirus protection, and regularly updating your system and security software.</p>
